##Social Lab

Social Lab aims to understand how illusory social agents come to form a central part of psychotic symptoms by understanding how the cognitive representation of social agents is affected in people with psychosis.

This project takes an innovative approach that looks specifically at how social agent representation – the ability to create, track, maintain and update representations of individuals – differs in people with psychotic symptoms.

Social Lab is powered by [oTree](http://www.otree.org/).
