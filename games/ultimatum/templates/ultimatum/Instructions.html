The        experiment is about how to divide this amount.        The proposer will make the responder a take-it-or-leave-it offer,        which the responder can accept or reject.        If the offer is rejected, both will        receive {{ Constants.payoff_if_rejected }}.    </p>    <h4 class='panel-sub-heading'>        Proposer's role    </h4>    <p>        The proposer has the options to divide the {{ Constants.endowment }} points between the        two players any way he likes by giving any number of points to the other player.    </p>    <h4 class='panel-sub-heading'>        Responder's role    </h4>    <p>        {% if not group.strategy %}            The responder can either accept or reject the offer.        {% else %}            While the proposer makes the offer, the responder can select            which {{ Constants.offer_choices_count }} offers stated above            to accept or reject.            After the proposer has made the offer, it will be either            accepted or rejected according to the responder's choices.        {% endif %}    </p>    <h4 class='panel-sub-heading'>        Results    </h4>    <p>        {% if not group.strategy %}            In the end, when both players have made their decision, a            results page will be displayed.            Here the offer will be displayed once more, and whether it was            accepted or rejected.        {% else %}            A results page will be displayed once both players have made            their decisions and those decisions have been implemented.            Here, it will be shown whether the offer was accepted or            rejected.        {% endif %}    </p>    <p>        Furthermore, one of the following two payoffs will be displayed:        <ul>            <li>If the offer is accepted, the players will receive a payoff                accordingly            </li>            <li>If the offer is rejected, both players will                receive {{ Constants.payoff_if_rejected }}</li>        </ul>    </p>    <p>        At the very end of the game you will be asked to guess if  you played against a human or a bot opponent.    </p></div>
