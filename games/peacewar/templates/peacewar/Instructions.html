    <p>
    	In this task, you will play against a partner in a game where you have the chance
		to communicate your intentions before making a decision about whether to wage war or declare peace.
		Your partner could be a human or a computer. Your job is to win as much money as possible
		and work out which type of partner you think you are playing against.
    </p>
    <p>
		The game will have several rounds. For each round, you will first be asked to send a message about
		your intentions - whether you intend to start a war, or declare peace. This is just to communicate with your
		partner and you don't have to stick to your stated intentions.
    </p>
    <p>
    	After you have stated your intentions, each of you then will then make your decision: to actually wage war or declare peace.
    </p>
    <p>
		<ul>
			<li>If you <strong>both choose peace</strong>, you both win 10 cents.
			<li>If <strong>one person chooses peace, but the other chooses war</strong>, the person who chooses war wins 15 cents and the person who chooses peace wins nothing.
			<li>If you <strong>both choose war</strong>, you win 5 cents each.
		</ul>
