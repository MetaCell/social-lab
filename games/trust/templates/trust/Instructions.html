        You will be randomly and anonymously paired with another participant or a bot.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of you will be selected at random to be participant A; the other will be participant B.
        You will learn whether you are participant A or B prior to making any decision.
    </p>
    <p>
        To start, participant A receives {{ Constants.amount_allocated }};
        participant B receives nothing.
        Participant A can send some or all of
        his {{ Constants.amount_allocated }} to participant B.
        Before B receives these points they will be multiplied
        by {{ Constants.multiplication_factor }}. Once B receives
        the tripled points he can decide to send some or all of his points to A, or to keep them all for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the very end of the game you will be asked to guess if  you played against a human or a bot partner.
